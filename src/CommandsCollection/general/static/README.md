See `ddev --help` for all available commands within your project.

You can provide additional [custom commands](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/custom-commands/) beneath the autogenerated dcc commands.

> **_NOTE:_** If there is no special [overwriting](#overwrite) defined, all `dcc-*` commands will be automatically updated when updating or installing the composer dependencies.

## Technical part

The DCC package comes with different functionalities.

### Overview

`faq/` - The __faq__ directory contains additional helpful information append to some commands.

Append something like the following line to include a faq section:

```bash
sh "$(dirname "$0")/../faq/dcc-faq-web-sync.sh"
```

`scripts/` - The __scripts__ directory contains several bash scripts to be reused in the commands.

You can use the additional scripts with the following line:

```bash
. "$(dirname "$0")/../scripts/dcc-colors.sh"
```

`dcc-config.yaml` - The config file contains configuration for the DCC process.

`dcc-config.sh` - The config file contains configuration for the DCC commands. You can overwrite them to your specific project needs. 

<a name="overwrite"></a>
### Overwrite

If you want to overwrite or skip an automatic generated DDEV command, you can use the following two possibilites:

#### Extend

Extend a DCC command and add them manually to the project git. To avoid the overwriting of the command, extend the command with one of the following keywords within a comment:

- `<keep/>`
- `<ingore/>`
- `<custom/>`

#### Ignore

If you want to avoid the copy process of specific commands, you can define them within the `dcc-config.yaml`:

```yaml
ignoreFiles:
  - web/dcc-test
```
